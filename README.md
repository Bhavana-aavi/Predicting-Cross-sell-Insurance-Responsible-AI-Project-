Predicting Cross-sell Insurance: Responsible AI Project | Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, LIME, SHAP
•	Built a predictive model with Python and scikitlearn to detect cross-selling opportunities between health and vehicle insurance products.
•	Utilized Machine Learning algorithms to extract insights from customer data and policy details for precise predictions.
•	Incorporated Responsible AI practices by integrating LIME and SHAP for transparent and interpretable model outcomes.
•	Effectively communicated the rationale behind model predictions, improving decision-making for insurance cross-selling strategies.
